# Examples

- `pagerank`: A benchmark script that runs PageRank algorithm. The code is based on a Python example from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#Python).
- `ec-original`: Ten genomic benchmarks programs that we ran on DOVE without any modification. Please refer to our full paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05195) for more details.
- `ec-modified`: A genomic benchmark program named `calc_LD` required some modifications to run on frontend. Please refer to our full paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05195) for more details.

The `ec-original` and `ec-modified` scripts are sourced from [this repository](https://github.com/ekfchan/evachan.org-Rscripts), and is licensed under the GPL 2. The `pagerank` script was written by us, based on available resources. We license this under MIT, as with the remainder of the source.
